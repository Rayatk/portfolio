                        <p>
                            Hello there! I'm a recent graduate in Software Engineering from Carleton University, having completed my studies in January 2024. As a dedicated web development enthusiast, my expertise lies in JavaScript and Java. I've furthered my knowledge through multiple online courses and certifications in Java, a programming language renowned for its versatility in web applications. My practical application of Java includes creating diverse projects such as a calculator, tic-tac-toe game, and a chatbot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond academic achievements, I bring over two years of hands-on experience as a web developer intern at The Daily Star, a prominent newspaper in Bangladesh. During my tenure, I actively contributed to maintaining and updating the main news site, ensuring its functionality and accessibility. I played a crucial role in a significant layout update, enhancing the user interface and experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Complementing my technical skills are strong interpersonal and organizational abilities cultivated through leadership, volunteer roles, and part-time positions in retail sales. In various capacities, I led group projects, organized school events, and excelled in Model United Nations conferences, refining my communication, collaboration, and creative thinking skills. As a salesperson at Rexall Pharmacy Group and Best Buy Canada, I consistently delivered excellent customer service, boosted sales by 25%, and managed finances and inventory.
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                            Passionate about crafting innovative solutions for real-world challenges, I am actively seeking full-time positions in front-end, back-end, or UI/UX development. I am eager to apply my skills and enthusiasm to create impactful and user-friendly web solutions. If you come across opportunities aligning with my profile, I would greatly appreciate your support in sharing this post and considering me for any relevant positions. Thank you!
                        </p>
